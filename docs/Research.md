# Research & Market Scan

## Landscape
Existing tools: Notion templates, Craft.do, ChatGPT chats, some PRD generators.  
**Gap:** Lack of guided PM pedagogy + persistent context + KPI literacy.

## Competitive Teardown (Quick)
- **Notion Templates**: Great structure; no intelligence.  
- **Generic Chatbots**: Intelligent but unstructured; no PM pedagogy.  
- **Specialized PM AI apps**: Limited transparency; mixed quality.

## User Interviews (Guide)
- What part of PRD is hardest? (e.g., metrics, risks, scope)  
- What would “good enough” output look like?  
- What’s your tolerance for AI hallucinations?

## Insights → Requirements
- Users want **editable** output, not black‑box PDFs.  
- Need **examples** per section (e.g., “good KPI for B2C onboarding”).  
- Export to **Markdown** and **copy to Notion** is essential.
