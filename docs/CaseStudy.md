# Case Study — AIVA (Generated 2025-10-31)

## 1. Context & Problem
New PMs lack guided, contextual assistance to convert ideas into production‑ready PRDs with measurable KPIs.

## 2. Process
Discovery → PRD → Wireframes → Architecture → MVP → Test → Iterate.

## 3. Results (MVP)
- PRD generation end‑to‑end from a single idea prompt.  
- KPI suggestions and competitor quick‑scan.  
- Export to Markdown.

## 4. What I Learned
- Narrow scope accelerates user value.  
- Prompt design + sectioned output improves editability.  
- Clear error handling matters as much as “smart” output.

## 5. Next Steps
- Firebase auth + cloud save.  
- Template packs by domain (FinTech/EdTech).  
- Inline examples and learning nuggets.
